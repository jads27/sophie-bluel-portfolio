This project was carried out as part of my OpenClassrooms web developer training, where I was responsible for developing the front-end interface for an interior architectâ€™s portfolio using vanilla JavaScript, including a presentation page for works, an admin login system, and a media upload modal, all integrated with API calls to dynamically manage the gallery projects.
